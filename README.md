## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

Before using Solarized Colorscheme, please ensure that you have the following requirements installed:

- [Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)

## Installation

To use the Solarized color scheme in your code editor or terminal, 
you can install the Solarized colorscheme plugin using the Packer plugin manager. 
Packer is a popular plugin manager for Neovim and Vim, and it allows you to easily install and manage plugins for your editor.

To install the Solarized colorscheme plugin via Packer, you can follow the steps below.

`~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua`
```lua
use {
  'maxmx03/solarized.nvim',
  config = function ()
    local success, solarized = pcall(require, 'solarized')

    vim.o.background = 'dark'

    solarized.setup {
      theme = 'neovim',
      transparent = false
    }

    vim.cmd 'colorscheme solarized'
  end
}
```

## Switching between Dark and Light Mode

By default, the Solarized color scheme is set to use the dark mode variant. However, if you prefer a lighter background, you can easily switch to the light mode variant.
To switch to the light mode variant, you can add the following line to your Neovim or Vim configuration file:

`vim.o.background = 'light'`

This will set the background color to a light gray color, allowing you to use the Solarized light mode color palette.
If you prefer the dark mode variant, you can set the background color to a darker color by adding the following line to your configuration file instead:

`vim.o.background = 'dark'`


## Configuration Options

The Solarized color scheme provides several configuration options that you can use to customize the look and feel of the colors. Here is a list of the available options and their default values:

| Option       | Default            | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `theme`      | `'vim'`            | The theme comes in three styles: `vim`, `neovim`, `vscode` |
| `transparent`| `false`            | Enable and disable background transparency                 |
| `colors`     | `{}` or `function` | You can add new colors or override the defaults            |
| `highlights` | `{}` or `function` | You can add new highlights or override the defaults        |


## Theme

The theme option allows you to choose between the three available theme styles: vim, neovim, and vscode. The vim theme uses a slightly different color palette than the neovim and vscode themes. By default, the neovim theme is used. To change the theme, add the following line to your Neovim or Vim configuration file:

```lua
solarized.setup {
  theme = 'vim' -- or 'neovim' or 'vscode'
}
```

## Transparent

The transparent option allows you to enable or disable background transparency. By default, transparency is disabled. To enable transparency, add the following line to your Neovim or Vim configuration file:

```lua
solarized.setup {
  transparent = true
}
```

## Colors

The colors option allows you to add new colors or override the default color palette. This option accepts a table or a function that returns a table. The table should contain color definitions using hexadecimal RGB values. By default, this option is set to an empty table. Here is an example of how to set the colors option to a table:
 
```lua
require("solarized").setup({
  colors = {
    bg      = "#282a36",
    bg_alt  = "#44475a",
    comment = "#6272a4",
    fg      = "#f8f8f2",
    content = "#f8f8f2",
    yellow  = "#f1fa8c",
    orange  = "#ffb86c",
    red     = "#ff5555",
    magenta = "#ff79c6",
    violet  = "#bd93f9",
    blue    = "#6272a4",
    cyan    = "#8be9fd",
    green   = "#50fa7b",

  }
})
```
In this example, we're using the Dracula color scheme by setting the colors table to a list of color values that match the Dracula color palette. You can replace these values with your own custom colors if you prefer.

## Highlights

The highlights option allows you to add new highlight groups or override the default highlight groups. This option accepts a table or a function that returns a table. The table should contain highlight group definitions that use the color names defined in the colors table. By default, this option is set to an empty table. Here is an example of how to set the highlights option to a table:

```lua
solarized.setup {
  colors = {
    bg      = "#282a36",
    bg_alt  = "#44475a",
    comment = "#6272a4",
    fg      = "#f8f8f2",
    content = "#f8f8f2",
    yellow  = "#f1fa8c",
    orange  = "#ffb86c",
    red     = "#ff5555",
    magenta = "#ff79c6",
    violet  = "#bd93f9",
    blue    = "#6272a4",
    cyan    = "#8be9fd",
    green   = "#50fa7b",
  },
  highlights = function(colors, darken, lighten, blend)
    return {
      Normal       = { fg = colors.fg, bg = colors.bg },
      Comment      = { fg = colors.comment, bg = darken(colors.bg, 10), italic = true },
      Constant     = { fg = colors.cyan },
      Identifier   = { fg = colors.green },
      Statement    = { fg = colors.yellow },
      PreProc      = { fg = colors.orange },
      Type         = { fg = colors.red },
      Special      = { fg = colors.magenta },
      Visual       = { bg = blend(colors.magenta, colors.bg, 1.25) },
    }
  end
}
```
Here's a brief explanation of the `darken`, `lighten`, and `blend` functions that you can use in your Lua code:

- `darken(color, amount)`: Returns a darker version of the input `color` by reducing the value (i.e., brightness) component of the color by `amount` (a value between 0 and 1). For example, `darken('#FF0000', 0.5)` would return a darker shade of red.

- `lighten(color, amount)`: Returns a lighter version of the input `color` by increasing the value (i.e., brightness) component of the color by `amount` (a value between 0 and 1). For example, `lighten('#FF0000', 0.5)` would return a lighter shade of red.

- `blend(color, blend_color, amount)`: Returns a blended version of the input `color` and `blend_color`, where `amount` specifies the strength of the blend (a value between 0 and 1). A value of 0 would result in the original `color`, and a value of 1 would result in `blend_color`. For example, `blend('#FF0000', '#00FF00', 0.5)` would result in a blend of red and green, which is yellow.

These functions can be useful for generating variations of a given color, or for creating more complex color schemes by blending multiple colors together. The `blend` function in particular can be used to simulate a "glow" effect by blending a color with a brighter version of itself.
